# Project Brief: Voicify

## Project Overview
Voicify is a command-line tool that enables voice recording and transcription with global keyboard shortcuts. It allows users to record their voice with a keystroke and have it automatically transcribed using LLMs like OpenAI Whisper. The tool includes a plugin architecture that can intelligently call actions based on voice input, enabling seamless voice-controlled workflows.

## Core Goals
1. Provide an efficient voice-to-text workflow triggered by global keyboard shortcuts
2. Deliver high-quality transcription using OpenAI Whisper
3. Implement a flexible plugin system for extending functionality
4. Support major Linux display servers (X11 and Wayland)
5. Maintain a clean, maintainable codebase following Go best practices
