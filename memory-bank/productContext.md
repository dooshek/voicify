# Product Context

## Problem Space
Voicify addresses several key challenges:
1. **Keyboard/Mouse Fatigue**: Reduces the need for constant typing, especially for users with RSI or those who prefer voice input
2. **Context Switching**: Allows capturing thoughts without interrupting workflow
3. **Accessibility**: Provides alternative input method for users with mobility limitations
4. **Efficiency**: Voice can be faster than typing for certain types of content

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Integration**: The tool should feel like a natural extension of the OS
- **Minimal Friction**: Recording should start with a single keyboard shortcut
- **Intelligent Handling**: Transcriptions should be routed to appropriate actions based on content
- **Non-Intrusive**: The tool should operate in the background until needed

## Product Vision
Voicify aims to be the go-to voice command tool for developers and power users, enabling:
- Quick note-taking through dictation
- IDE command execution through voice
- Email composition by voice
- Content capture from various sources (as indicated in IDEAS.md)

## Key Differentiators
- Lightweight command-line interface rather than heavy GUI application
- Plugin architecture for extensible functionality
- Focus on developer workflows rather than general dictation
- Cross-platform support including both X11 and Wayland

## Future Opportunities
From IDEAS.md and project context:
- Plugin to capture web content from clipboard links and save to Obsidian
- Memory function to store and retrieve information in a vector database
- Potential for additional AI integration beyond transcription
